Description
===========

WebBrowserPassView is a password recovery tool that reveals the passwords
stored by the following Web browsers: Internet Explorer (Version 4.0 -
11.0), Mozilla Firefox (All Versions), Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
This tool can be used to recover your lost/forgotten password of any
Website, including popular Web sites, like Facebook, Yahoo, Google, and
GMail, as long as the password is stored by your Web Browser.

After retrieving your lost passwords, you can save them into
text/html/csv/xml file, by using the 'Save Selected Items' option
(Ctrl+S).



System Requirements And Limitations
===================================


* This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows
  2000, and up to Windows 10, including 64-bit systems. Older versions of
  Windows (Windows 98/ME) are not supported, because this utility is a
  Unicode application.
* Currently, WebBrowserPassView cannot retrieve passwords from external
  hard-drive (Except of Firefox Web browser). Support for that might be
  added in future versions.
* On Internet Explorer 7.0-9.0, the passwords are encrypted with the
  URL of the Web site, so WebBrowserPassView uses the history file of
  Internet Explorer to decrypt the passwords. If you clear the history of
  Internet Explorer, WebBrowserPassView won't be able to decrypt the
  passwords.
* On Google Chrome - passwords originally imported from Internet
  Explorer 7.0-9.0, cannot be decrypted.
